ᯤ Just a silly CLI game I made using python to refresh my skills.  You guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50. Each round keeps track of your attempts, and the program stores your best score across games •𐃷•.

🌸 Features:
✎ Random number between 1 and 50
✎ Input validation to ensure numbers only
✎ Stats tracking:

✎ Play again loop
✎ Colorful terminal output with personalized username (in pink 💗)
✎ Silly and cute styling for fun

🎀PS:
This was just a silly project to get me back into programming after stopping for almost a year. I know it's very simple but bare with me (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )!!

My next project might be some shopping sim with a job mechanic. We shall see!

Thank you for downloading my project. I love you <3
